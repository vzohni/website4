Guitar Plays You is a project for a class I developed in Fall of 2013. In entails an electrical guitar connected to a computer to a projection/monitor/TV that will take the kinesthetic data from the guitar. This was done with an accelerometer/tilt sensor from a Nintendo Wii-Remote (Wiimote) attached onto the headstock of the guitar. With this data, sound will be generated depending on the user's placement of the guitar and Wiimote. The pitch is determined by the x and y axis in a 3D space, which is assigned to a G major scale. The guitar is tuned in open G, so the user can openly strum the guitar, and move it around to create music without any previous training of the instrument. Visuals are created to accompany the sounds, and provide the user with a unique and enjoyable experience!
