RBC Bluebird was developed by myself and Owen Devine for the RBC Make It Mobile hackathon. We had 24 hours to create a unique banking app for RBC, and we developed a simplified and stylized version of the existing RBC app using Android Studio and Java. The app includes an interest rate calculator, which calculates to fractions of a penny how much money you are making in real time. The "Make A Payment" option uses Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to connect your phone to a credit/debit machine to make a payment. Other features include an ATM locator of nearby ATM's and a settings page for more information on RBC banking. Owen and I ended up winning 3rd place!
