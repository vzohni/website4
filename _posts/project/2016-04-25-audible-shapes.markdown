Audible Shapes is a 3D generative music visualizer. It allows the user to create a unique soundscape and manipulate objects within a 3D space. These objects will then generate sound and in combination create a piece of music or sound art. The user will simply use their hands for creating the objects, giving them a sense of familiarity and simplicity. The mixture of sound and interaction will create an immersive and enjoyable environment for anyone to create music. 

This was my final project for my Digital Media major created in Unity 3D with C# scripting and Max/MSP. Stefano and I spent the entire school year working on this from start to finish, with the idea of enabling anyone to play music with just their hands.
