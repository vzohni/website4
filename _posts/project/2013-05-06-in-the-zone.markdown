In The Zone was an indie rock/alternative radio show, on Mondays at 2 â€“ 3pm CHRY 105.FM Focusing on local (Canadian) and current music, mainly within the blisteringly loud and dreamily reverberated feedback sub-genre called shoegaze, and also featured related sub-genres. The show lasted for 2 years, broadcasting to over 200,000+ listeners across the GTA.
